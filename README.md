This repository contains dotfiles specific to my Ubuntu distro. As I have different distros for different hardware and/or purpose, I have decided to make different repos for each of them, so my configuration directory is not cluttered. 

## ‚ö° Main features

- **Terminal emulator**: Gnome-terminal. 
- **Shell**: Zsh + starship prompt (no plugins).
- **Text editor**: Neovim.
- **Window manager**: Gnome.
- **Multimedia**: Gnome toolsuite.

## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To perform the installation, run the `install.sh` script. This script will backup any dotfile you may have and will symlink the ones contained in the this repo. It will also install some scripts necessary for *gnome-terminal* to adapt its color scheme to system theme changes.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Warning 

These dotfiles are customized for my preferences. Use at your own risk! It is recommended:

1. To do a backup of your current dotfiles.
2. To review the dotfiles before applying them.
3. To apply dotfiles gradually.

## ü§ù Contributions

Though these dotfiles are personal, any kind of suggestion or improvement is suggested. Please, open an issue or merge request to discuss changes.
